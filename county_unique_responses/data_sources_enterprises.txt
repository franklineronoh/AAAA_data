What policy frameworks support women-led value chains? Relevant policies include the Crop Regulation of 2019, the County Gender Policy, and public procurement rules that prioritize women and youth-led enterprises. What cooperatives enhance women’s voices? Potato and dairy cooperatives/unions are active in Laikipia and provide women with collective bargaining power, extension services, and access to markets. Are there any policy gaps to address for women? Gaps remain in access to credit and technical support for smallholder women farmers, particularly those in informal or subsistence enterprises. What policy interventions and investments can strengthen women enterprises? Key interventions include funding VSLAs, investing in value addition infrastructure, and supporting digital literacy and access for women. What policies hinder or enable women’s climate-resilient enterprises? While some policies provide funds for climate-smart agriculture, limited technical capacity and low funding levels hinder effective implementation for women. What support is needed for women and marginalized groups to thrive? Comprehensive support including financial access, digital tools, training, and favorable policy environments is essential. Programs like NAVCDP and targeted enterprise funds can drive inclusive development.
