Availability at Home- Women often spend more time at or near the household, making it easier for them to manage farm-based and subsistence enterprises, especially those that do not require travel or long hours away from home. Nature of the Enterprises- Many of the enterprises where women are dominant tend to have low financial returns or are viewed as subsistence-oriented, which historically have been assigned to women. These include crops like sorghum or sweet potatoes and activities like chicken rearing. Less Labour Intensity and Type of Work- Tasks involving bending, or lighter tools are culturally perceived as more suited to women Cultural beliefs- For instance, poultry rearing is traditionally viewed as a woman’s responsibility. This socialization supports women’s continued involvement in these sectors. Women often have specialized skills in processing and handling certain crops and products—such as fermenting sorghum or preparing local poultry products—making them key actors in adding value at the household and community level. Some of these enterprises require minimal capital or land, making them more accessible to women, especially in contexts where women may have limited access to resources like credit, equipment, or land ownership.

Cultural limitation- prevents women from venturing in their enterprises eg women cannot herd camels or cows policy incentives- the county is promoting kitchen garden for nutritional purpose Availability of resources-women venture into those enterprises with less capital intensity Market-the enterprises women lead in are market ready their enterprises are for subsistence -they major on what the family use and get some income
Cultural norms favor their involvement in food security-related ventures. Low financial entry requirements make them accessible. Women-led enterprises align well with flexible household responsibilities. Policy incentives encourage female participation in agribusiness.
Duration of the crop on the farm. They prefer plats that take a short time on the farm and can go to market fast. They prefer food crops for food security at home. They prefer crops that have a small capital investment. Land area available is small. Thus the prefer crops with high yield on a small area of land. Ease in getting local market for their produce. This also determines the choice of crop. Crops which do not require legal controls and regulators to market (coffee or tea) are preferred.
Ease of entry Cultural norms Financial aspect
Ease of entry and cultural norms for ALVs and chicken High returns for dairy Policy incentives for dairy and banana Interventions by NGOs i.e. capacity building Women empowerment
Ease of entry, low input requirements especially for sorghum and finger millet, easy post-harvest management cultural issues in terms of land ownership that is men dominated forces women to engage in short cycle crop production Affirmative action plan: involvement of women in agricultural enterprises Gender mainstreaming policy: Access rural finance: saccos, women associations, table banking village lending and savings
Ease of management and Cultural norms Perceived to be low income by men
Factors to success Replicability Necessary condition Adaptation to climate change YES Suitable climatic conditions Short maturity periods Enabling environment(interventions, sensitizations)

High demand for ALVs High demand for eggs and milk Easy to manage Availability of inputs
In terms of feeding, if small numbers and small space to occupy. those value chains that require minimal resources become for women. Enterprises that require small capital is for women. E.G in Kuresoi if the number of poultry is above 50 or 100 it becomes for men. This is believed discriminatory as women are denied chance of ownership of profitable value chains Transport logistic -male youths The young females are missing in all these value chains and activities The traditional cash crops e.g tea, avocadoes, coffee, pyrethrum are elderly men mostly own pyrethrum, the farmers are mostly 60+. So is to coffee
Low capital required/ease of entry

Men don't see value in some value chains (Cultural aspect) ie millet require a lot of attention Ease of access to seeds (Affordable to women) Subsistent crops (small scale and less input) Not mechanized making it easier for women to venture into Food security- millet and sorghum is considered key for nutrition ie for young children

There is a policy for “Inua mama na kuku”, every year there is a budget for this in the county. Socialization. Women have been socialized to think that the dairy, cashcrops, are for men
cultural : women play roles in preparing foods during ceremonies e.g circumcision women provide indigenous vegetables. they are not labour and capital intensive, easily available inputs and women find it easy to have them. They are mostly easy to carry. Readily available market from the neighbours. They are largely consumed within the community
less labour intensive and quick returns on investments Women prefer engaging in value chains predominated by other women and with low initial investment capital working in groups for sustainability
small portion of lands, noncontrol of land, cultral norms- some got the parents , those with less value are given to women
small portion of lands, noncontrol of land, cultural norms- man is the breadwinner of the family so the woman, as a housewife may start farming activities for livelihood sustainability and to keep busy, those with less value are given to women
