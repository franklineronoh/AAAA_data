Women and youth are mostly involved in production tasks such as planting and feeding animals. Men and youth take charge of marketing and transportation, which are more mobile and capital-intensive activities. What barriers prevent women from expanding their roles in these enterprises? Key barriers include lack of access to land, limited capital, insufficient time due to unpaid care work, and minimal control over household and enterprise resources.
Women: Animal care, crop tending, food processing, household commerce. Men: Market negotiations, bulk livestock sales, financial transactions. Youth: Technology-driven agribusiness, product marketing, innovation. Elders: Advisory roles, preserving indigenous farming techniques.
