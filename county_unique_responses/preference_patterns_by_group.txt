- less labour/work load intensive activities are favorable to women - less capital-intensive activities are favorable to women - short seasoned enterprises favorable to women. - elderly people avoid credits from financial institution to support farming
-Beekeeping was initially practised by the Ndorobo clan who were classified as poor. Its now an emerging enterprise for other communities especially the women and the youth -Women values chain selection cut across all age groups-No special values chains for the elderly -Adoption of small livestock by women such as poultry and Rabbits rearing since they are not capital intensive enterprise
-Women are more involved in agriculture compared to the youth and men, this is because men and youth prefer white / blue collar jobs. Agriculture is considered secondary. -Men own most of the land thus limiting the youth’s participation in dairy farming. -Elderly women are not heavily invested in agriculture because they fear harvesting.-
Cash crops and industrial crops are predominantly a male dominated value chain. Traditional crops are mainly dominated by women. High value and short term crops are mainly dominated by youth. The youth are dominating the transportation node across all the value chains. Note motorbikes, small cars etc. Dairy cow value chain is dominated by men. Dairy goats and sheep is dominated by women. Poultry farming is dominated by women.

Gender Dynamics in Crop Enterprises- Both men and women are actively involved in the cultivation of high-value crops such as coffee and maize, due to their significant economic returns. However, coffee has seen a notable rise in women-led involvement, especially through initiatives such as Women in Coffee, which empower women to take ownership and leadership roles within the value chain. Shifts in Traditional Roles- Crops like sweet potatoes, traditionally associated with women and subsistence farming, are increasingly being grown for commercial purposes, with both genders participating. Women are also playing a growing role in poultry farming, contributing to both household nutrition and income. Gendered Labor in Value Chains- In the tea value chain, women are predominant, especially in labor-intensive tasks like tea picking. Across the entire value chain—from production to processing—women play a critical role, although ownership and decision-making still tend to favor men in some areas. There is an emerging trend where youth are engaging more in enterprise-related services, particularly in transportation, such as ferrying produce and inputs. Changing Gender Roles in Livestock Enterprises- In the dairy sector, approximately 70% of registered milk suppliers are now women, a significant change from previous years when the sector was male-dominated. This shift is largely attributed to increasing women’s empowerment and targeted support initiatives. In the tea sector, some families are now registering farm numbers under women’s names, and there’s a growing effort to involve youth in enterprise ownership and management..

Income levels influence the age Technologies and innovations involved Duration of taken by the enterprise to generate income Inputs and labour involved
Income levels influence the level of investment in agriculture Technologies and innovations involved Duration of taken by the enterprise to generate income or returns Market availability of the finished product Initial capital Inputs required Labour involved Risk level
Labor intensive enterprises are preferred by men due to their physique and mechanized operations. High return enterprises are men dominated High investment enterprises are men dominated The youth tend to engage in fast returning enterprises Most women are participants in terms of providing labor however the returns (access and control) are handled by men
Maize, beans, potatoes,avocadoes, dairy and poultry Poultry- preferred by women because of the viable start-up Dairy- men (Cultural aspect), women provide labour (feeding, milking) Potatoes- male dominated- women offer labour Tea - male dominated
Men Cattle(beef and dairy), goats, banana, tomatoes, onions,watermelon, rice Women Goat rearing, poultry, dairy in highland areas, horticulture (fruits and vegetables) and pulses(beans and peas), maize and beans, cassava (kimanga) Youth poultry, horticulture Elderly poultry and goats, maize and beans on small scale, pulses
Men Poultry, Rice, Cotton and Fishing Women Poultry, Africa Leafy Vegetables, Sweet potatoes, Ground Nuts Youth Poultry, Tomatoes Elderly Aquaculture
Men engage in high income enterprises than women Youth get involved in end product value and not much in production
Men prefer leadership sectors in enterprises as well as enterprises with high investments and returns. enterprises that are also labour intensive. Youth lack investment capital and land. access to land but no ownership and control. Youth prefer enterprises with quick returns eg. data collection activities. they have access to gadgets. Women mostly involved herding and milking activities in livestock.
Men prefer livestock trading and large-scale farming due to financial control. Women dominate dairy farming, poultry, and vegetable production, which require lower capital investment. Youth explore agri-tech businesses, focusing on digital platforms and value-added innovations. Elders contribute knowledge on indigenous crops and pastoral farming techniques.

Poultry - Poultry is for women but if the economic value is more this shifts to ownership by men Through NAVCDP they conduct broad participatory integrated community development plan - can get gendered info in this report. All the 50 agri wards have the CIDP community integrated development plan - can get this information in soft copy from the CDA Dairy goats - female are predominantly the owners especially if they are a few, if they are more this becomes for men dairy cattle - mostly men. feeding is both gender, milk goes to women especially evening milk. The morning milk is for men. beekeeping - male dominated horticulture - if it is kitchen garden it is for women otherwise if it is commercial e.g carrots, green peas, cabbages, this is for men *SCAOs have this
Preference at particular value chains node like youths preferring value chains that are less labour intensive and have quick returns on investments Women prefer engaging in value chains predominated by other women and with low initial investment capital Women preferences in working in groups for sustainability Men dominates in value chain nodes that are high in capital and labour intensive The elder prefer value chains that are less labour intensive and low management
Quick returns especially for the youths thus going for value chains with less maturity time. Increase in demand for nutritional sources such as proteins due to increase in population. Men are involved in capital intensive enterprises e.g. cash crops Women are more involved in food crops Enterprise diversification. Shrinkage of land
The elderly men prefer rearing cattle, sheep and goats and beekeeping, while the elderly women prefer crop farming of indigenous vegetables and poultry. The youth are involved in sheep and goats rearing, sheer fattening and tree nursery. The rest of the men apart from the traditional cattle and sheep rearing are involved in farming of maize, wheat, irish potatoes and beekeeping. Women are into beekeeping, cultivation of maize and beans and also involved in the dairy products.
Women and men are equally involved in the different agricultural enterprises. Men are involved in enterprises that fetch more income like coffee, while women are involved in enterprises like bananas and milk. However, once the women’s enterprises are commercialised, the men tend to get involved. -There have been changing patterns in predominance, only coffee has been static. -Women aggressively take up enterprises that fetch income, this leads to flooded markets
Women and youth prefer short-term enterprises, Low production volumes are associated with women Higher volumes(commercialisation) are associated with men, Women's preferred enterprises are poultry and ALVs Men are directly involved with dairy. Women are involved in all enterprises in terms of labour.
Women tend to like small stock, local vegetables, Youth prefer high-value and short-season enterprises Men Prefer long-term enterprises (because of access to resources like land)
Youths go for short period maturity enterprises, friendly enterprises, e.g. they may go for value addition, transport, marketing (social media, IT) Men go for high value capital intensive value chains like dairy/sugarcane/coffee/cotton productions Women do short-term crops/subsistence crops like ground nuts, vegetables, african leafy vegetables, finger millet, orphaned crops (cow peas, green grams, sorghum, sweet potatoes, cassava) people tend to shy away from capital intensive enterprises Geography-lakeside dwellers fish, Traditional value chains are preferred to the conventional ones
livestock: Except for poultry and dairy goats, they are mostly dominated by men. Goats under extensive farming systems are mostly for men. The rule of thumb is that when the population of these livestock increases , men start dominating. Women have access to all of them during milking, feeding, but not to sell them. chicken - male youth and women Crop: Along the Kerio valey the farming activities which involve irrigation are dominated by men. Cash crops are for men, while subsistence is for women. coffee, cotton, pyrethrum, tea,potatoes, -men watermelon, tomatoes, greengrams -male youth sorghum- mixed sweet potoes -mixed beans -women
livestock: dairy cattle are preferred by men, chicken for the women. Apiculture are mostly for the marginalized (“Ogiek”), the county has been supporting them with beehives and processing equipment. Crop: Pyrethrum, irish potato, and coffee are labour intensive and usually women do the work but the men take the cash. The perennial crops such as coffee, avocado are mostly done by elderly men since they have permanent ownership. the women and the youth are normally disadvantaged because they do not have the permanent ownership
the youths are active in onion farming due to fast returns -the men and women are majorly in food crops depending on the agroecological zones -women and youths are most involved in poultry-gives them an opportunity to make decisions and its less capital intensive and requires less space the youth are getting into sheep and goat rearing -the men are mostly on cattle and camels The women are adopting apiculture, not in actual production but on marketing women are active in marketing most of the enterprises -women are adopting aloe vera harvesting -as a coping mechanism during drought-use the sup to sell to business men-used in making other products
women tend to choose small enterprises eg sweet potatoes, green grams, cowpeas and indigenous chicken -do not own land, enterprises require less capital men tend to go for the major enterprise - men are decision makers elderly go for the less labour intensive enterprises such as weaving baskets and makuti. youth shift to small enterprises that have quick return but in most cases they are not involved in agriculture - they seek employment
