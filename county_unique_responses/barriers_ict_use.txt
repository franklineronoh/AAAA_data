Women face several challenges in utilizing digital platforms and ICT tools for enterprise development. Limited access to reliable internet connectivity remains a major barrier, particularly in remote rural areas. Additionally, many women lack the necessary digital devices, such as smartphones or computers, which restricts their ability to engage with online resources and platforms. Even when devices are available, a significant number of women have limited digital literacy, making it difficult to navigate applications and tools that could support their agricultural or business activities. To overcome these challenges, some women are participating in group training, leveraging community-based support systems, or relying on assistance from tech-savvy family members and extension officers to access and use digital tools effectively.
