-Yes, there’s need for capacity building and research development e.g new breeds
-Yes-in counties with similar agroecological zones- -the enterprises are also major staple food in the country
Access to financial services for startup capital. Policy frameworks ensuring equal resource distribution. Market linkages connecting different regions. Training programs expanding agribusiness knowledge.
Awareness on nutritional benefits
Conditions necessary Suitable climatic conditions for the growing of crops and raising of livestock based enterprises Availability factors of production (land, Capital, labor and technical knowhow)
Dairy cattle , poultry, potatoes, maize . Yes. As long as they have similar ecological, political, socio economic factors. Population is a factor in which high population provides the demand and market
Dairy/ poultry can be replicated considering the above factors
Men Cattle(beef and dairy), goats, banana, tomatoes, onions,watermelon, rice Women Goat rearing, poultry, dairy in highland areas, horticulture (fruits and vegetables) and pulses(beans and peas), maize and beans, cassava (kimanga) Youth poultry, horticulture Elderly poultry and goats, maize and beans on small scale, pulses
Men Poultry, Rice, Cotton and Fishing Women Poultry, Africa Leafy Vegetables, Sweet potatoes, Ground Nuts Youth Poultry, Tomatoes Elderly Aquaculture
Men maize, tomatoes, citrus, mango, coconut, cashew nuts, beef and dairy cattle, fishing Women casava, cowpeas, greengrams, sweetpotatoes, chicken Youth tomatoes, passion fruit Elderly baskets and makuti weaving
Most of these enterprises cut across most of the subcounties and wards Suitable agroecological zones across the counties Suitable technological options (e.g organic farming, suitable varieties and breeds)
No response provided
Varies with enterprise due to differences in agro-ecological conditions
Women - Sorghum, Poultry, Sweet potatoes,Finger millet Men- Tea, Dairy, Irish Potatoes, Avocadoes Highland areas, based on agroecological aspect Can be culturally accepted in other regions Indigenous vegetables ie spider plants, people in west rift prefer bitter variety
YES
Yes ,so long as the environmental and other conditions are available.
Yes, Suitability based on agro ecological requirement of each crop/livestock
Yes, Under the above conditions.
Yes, for instance ALVs can thrive most areas of the county due to similar agroecological conditions Eggs and Cow Milk, easy to manage and availability of inputs Knowledge and information on management of such enterprises
Yes, there’s need for training and capacity building, exchange programs, evidence based enterprise selection.
Yes, these enterprises can be replicated in other counties or regions, provided certain conditions are met. For instance, tea farming requires specific climatic conditions, adequate land size, availability of processing factories, and a reliable labor force. Additionally, enterprise replication depends heavily on awareness and sensitization. Communities must be informed about the economic and environmental benefits of the enterprises to encourage adoption. Creating enabling environments through infrastructure development, extension services, and farmer training is also essential for successful replication.
Yes-but it depends on variety and climate and soil and water availability Preferance and cultural acceptance of the enterprise
Yes. Environmental, cultural similarities needed. Capacity building needs to be considered
Yes. Environmental,availabilty of land, availabilty of favaurable credit. Capacity building needs to be considered
Yes. For commercial enterprises, there is need for availability of market, culture, acceptability, favorable climatic conditions.
Yes. The enterprises can be replicated in other counties, especially those with similar climatic conditions. Conditions necessary includes: Technology adoption Favourable weather conditions
Yes; climatic conditions dictates the suitability of the enterprise
● They can be replicated in other counties with similar agro ecological zones.
