-Due to climate change there has been an introduction of newer varieties of crops and seeds that require new chemicals , this has by extension locked women out.
-KCSAP-(Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Project) worked on tolerant crops-sorgum, finger millet and other crops that can do well. Apple mangoes were introduced Maize varieties that tolerate pests infestation -DK777 and 624 varieties have been introduced Fooder-the county promoted early maturing nappier called pakchong-takes one and a half -2 months to mature and the yields are higher than ordinary nappier-tree lucerne, desmodium and Calliandra. Dairy goats have also been adopted by the farmers and indigenous chicken -KECSAP and ASDSP-promoted indigenous chicken Apiculture- was introduced because of adaptability of different climatic conditions - adoption of early maturing sugarcane varieties -its taking 1yr to mature for commercial purpose
-hot weather, drought and flash floods affecting production of coffee and other crops, this has led to adoption of tolerant crop varieties and enterprises like fish farming and other resilient livestock breeds.
Crop Based enterprises Varietal selection (tolerant varieties, resistant varieties) Method of land preparation (sunken beds or raised beds) Dry planting or onset of rains Weeding (manual, chemical or mechanical) Crop protection: mechanical, chemical or manual Harvesting: mechanical and manual Type of crop to be planted: cereals or tuberous Livestock based enterprises Type of breed (either tolerant breeds or high yielding) Type of animal: Availability of fodder and feeds in conserved form Early warning system: sensitization on climate risk
Diversification of enterprises to minimize the risks of climatic changes effects Adoption of short term enterprise which escape the impact of changing climatic conditions. adoption of more adaptable livestock breeds and crop varieties
Diversification to other crops and livestock Revitalization of coffee due to introduction of disease resistant varieties especially coffee Berry disease on Ruiru 11 Rearing of improved Kienyeji chicken which is early maturing and multipurpose(Meat and eggs)
Economic empowerment for special group interest
Farmers are shifting to drought-resistant crops like sorghum and millet. Sustainable livestock practices (alternative feeds, water-efficient breeds) are becoming popular. Climate-smart technologies like solar irrigation and hydroponics are growing. Increasing weather unpredictability encourages diversification into agribusiness.
Farmers in the lowers areas are switching from maize to sorghum Farmers in the lowers areas are switching from beans to green grams Lower region focus on beef Higher region focus on dairy Lower regions rearing goats Mango is being adopted due to climate resilience Use of hybrid crops and seeds that are drought tolerant
Goats-galla breed are resilient Sheep-dorper sheep Kitchen gardening-to produce vegetables introduction of early maturing crops and those that are drought tolerant-greengrams, nyota beans, KS20 greengram, bulb onions, water melons and tomatoes Camels-resilient Beekeeping aquaculture through farm ponds-not many
Influenced diversification to other crops and livestock Influenced adoption of climate smart technologies, innovations and practises Influenced emergence of other support value chains such as pasture and pasture seed production, tree nursery and agroforestry Influence enhancement of apiculture value chain

Prolonged draught leads to adaption of tolerant varieties Prolonged cold seasons lead to adaption of resistant varieties .eg in potatoes – blight Change in climate has led to introduction to new enterprises eg in kaimbaga ward bean farming is emerging
Research on better varieties
Shift from cassava to maize (increase in pests and diseases) Shift from beans to Soya and Sweet Potatoes (unpredictable rainfall patterns)
Some pest and diseases that have emerged that is affecting maize making parts of the county not suitable for maize production ie African army warm, fall army warms Weather variability- seasons were well defined, no distinct seasons affecting the enterprises People are now going to short season and drought tolerant varieties more than before - Maize (DK77, Haraka 101, DH04, Hybrid 520) Livestock: Saiwals,jerseys, Improved kienyeji with high tolerance
The county does the suitability based on the AEZ climate, soils, past performance of crops. There was a new AEZ mapping in the county spatial planning. There was a slight change from the original AEZ mapping. Each crop has its own suitability. There has been an issue with deciding the right livestock to keep that are adaptable to the AEZ. The forage recommendation is another factor
The county is adopting climate smart agricultural practices e.g. irrigation Agro-ecology(production and utilization of local seeds) High performing dairy cows to eliminate the need for numerous animals in the quest to reduce Green House Gas emission Enterprise diversification Organic resource utilization
The preferred value chains/enterprises in the county have not been significantly altered by ongoing climate change. Improved drought and disease tolerant varieties, breeds and clones (in tea) have been preferred.
The reintroduction of indigenous food security crops (cassava, sweet potatoes, sorghum, finger millet) Introduction of irrigation schemes and green-house technology for production of high values horticulture crops The reintroduction of small Stock (improved goats) due to pasture scarcity Upscaling of bee-keeping activities
There has been a shift from indigenous towards improved and resilient varieties. The county is doing improved kienyeji chicken as a result of this. The county is promoting the coffee, avocado, macadamia, herbs and spices because climate has become suitable for them
There has been a shift from indigenous towards improved and resilient varieties. there is emphasis on drought tolerant livestock breeds and crop varieties, there are efforts upscale irrigation. early maturing varieties. have introduced zero-grazing
There has been an emergence of new enterprises
Traditional maize growing wards have ventured into other value chains for example Kuresoi was not a maize zone but now they are doing. There has been suitability shifts as a result of climate change.
enterprise diversification adoption of drought and disease tolerant varieties and breeds of crops and livestock respectively increased adoption of irrigation technologies intensification of production system
farm size,
· Longer periods of drought and short periods of rain have occassioned adoption of fast maturing crops/livestock value chains · Increased temperatures have influenced adoption of enterprises that tolerate heat stress · Increased floods have farmers adoption of perennial crops/fast /early maturing crops/cover crops/fish cages · Increased humidity has caused use of disease and pest resistant varities/breeds · Frequent incidences of strong winds have occassioned use of short and stout varieties and use of housed/indoor enterprises/planting of trees to act as wind breaks · Increased soil erosion –use of soil and water conservation structures/measures
