Cultural barriers Limited Access to Land: Despite constitutional guarantees, women in Murang'a often face cultural and legal barriers to land ownership, restricting their ability to invest in climate-resilient practices. Financial Constraints: Women-led enterprises struggle to secure funding due to stringent collateral requirements and limited access to formal financial services. Underrepresentation in Decision-Making: Women are often excluded from policy and decision-making processes, leading to strategies that do not fully address their specific needs.
