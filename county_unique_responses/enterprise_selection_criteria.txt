Agricultural and livestock enterprises were selected through a participatory process using the "one ward, one cooperative" model. Farmers led the selection, guided by criteria such as number of people involved, production volume, adaptability, and profitability. Enterprises were scored out of 45 to prioritize value chains per ward.
CIDP, Agriculture Stakeholder Platform, Community engagement processes through public barazas, (ward-based enterprises suitable are listed, prioritised according to suitability, profitability and ability to involve different genders and then finally ranked) Focused groups discussions on gender involvement.
Climate resilience is a major factor—we prioritize enterprises that can withstand drought. Market demand influences choices; we select enterprises with strong profitability and local preference. Government policies shape decisions, aligning enterprise selection with county and national agricultural strategies. Accessibility matters—enterprises that favor marginalized groups, such as women and youth, are prioritized.

In Nyamira County, a participatory approach was used, applying Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tools to engage communities in identifying available resources, current agricultural practices, and levels of gender participation in agriculture. The selection of enterprises was guided by several criteria, including: The potential for value chain growth and production, Opportunities for gender empowerment, and Historical and current performance of the value chains. An initial ranking exercise placed dairy as the top enterprise, followed by bananas, local vegetables, and indigenous chicken. A second ranking conducted in 2023 identified local vegetables, dairy, bananas, coffee, and avocado as the leading enterprises. The rise of avocado in the rankings was attributed to its growing export potential.
