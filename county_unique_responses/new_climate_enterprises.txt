-Poultry- during drought men would move around looking for pasture, leaving the women to opt find a source of nourishment in chicken. Men also see chicken as justa bird, not much value attached to it. -Aquaculture -Pasture conservation (specific hay species) -Sunflower- this is upcoming, for oil pressing and seed is used for livestock feed

Castor used for biofuel, sunflower (also included in BETA). Irrigation is promoted especially the household water ponds (farm ponds) for irrigation. Water efficient maize for Africa, DK series of maize are the emerging varieties for maize. AZOLLA is another promoted enterprise. Finger millet and sorghum has been new but now it is embraced more. Though Galla goats have been there before, there is more uptake now. Apiary has been enhanced more as a response to NAVCDP.

Enterprises like fast-maturing maize and bean varieties have emerged. However, men tend to dominate these due to better access to land and inputs, with women and youth underrepresented due to structural inequalities.
Expansion of rice farming from paddy to upland mostly done women Introduction of dryland arrow roots (Rangwe, Ndhiwa) mostly done by women Pigeon peas in Rangwe mostly done by women Introduction of new technologies on kitchen gardens by women Establishment of tree nurseries mainly by the youths
Hydroponic farming provides a solution to limited rainfall. Camel milk processing is gaining attention for its resilience in dry regions. Solar-powered irrigation systems help reduce water scarcity issues. Youth-led agritech ventures focus on climate-smart solutions.
Maize Avocado (hash)
Maize non-traditional places have embraced maize because they have become warm and the yield has increased. In some areas maize has been taking about 9 months but now taking shorter. Similarly this is happening for beans. Conditions have been more conducive for pests and diseases. There are emerging pests and diseases e.g the persian mines affects avocadoes Change of crop varieties e.g there are 3 -4 months has been adaptable to nakuru. Farmers have become open to short duration varieties

Several climate-resilient enterprises have emerged in Kericho County in response to climate challenges. Women are increasingly engaging in the cultivation of drought-tolerant crops such as sorghum and finger millet, while men are more involved in fodder production and the adoption of early-maturing sugarcane varieties for commercial purposes. Dairy goat farming has gained popularity among both men and women due to its adaptability and manageable scale. Additionally, apiculture has become a male-dominated enterprise, offering a viable alternative livelihood under changing climatic conditions.

The emerging and rapid growth of aquaculture in the county as farmers address the need to carry out water harvesting. They also engage in the farming of upland arrowroots farming to enhance sustainable land management. Farming of sunflower is growing to address fodder requirements and oil for household cooking. Sunflower is adaptable and can be farmed across various agricultural zones in the county.
The introduction of Galla Goats for breeding purposes to youth and women. Purchase of fodder seeds to all men, women and youth Fodder reserves/feed banks Grafted seedlings to youths and women Tolerant varieties for youths and women Emerging crops for example Moringa, Amaranthus, Mushroom: Rongo, Awendo, Kuria East/West Promotion of Africa Leafy vegetables across the county: Women groups
